  The first time Charlie & Nina met was at a Halloween party where several other Catholic young adults were gathered for a fun night. Nina went with her friend as two of the nurses from Grey’s Anatomy and was familiar with most everyone at the party. Charlie was invited by a friend, came dressed as Waldo, and was completely new to the young adult ministry crowd. At one point Nina went out to the back porch to grab another drink, and Charlie followed her outside to chat her up. When he mentioned he had been in the seminary Nina shared that she had been in the convent, and from then on they had infinite topics of conversation.

  Later they would meet up again by going to Mass together, although most of the time they never actually planned on it. See, they both went to Mass at the nearby Cathedral for the Sunday evening Mass, except Nina would be there a little early sitting by myself and Charlie would show up and decide to sit next to me. The first time this happened he came up to her row and, after genuflecting, ask her, “Is there enough room here I can squeeze in?” Due to the immense space of the Cathedral and the sprawl of attendees, Nina exclaimed, “Of course!” both from laughing as if there was no room but also from pure joy that he’d choose to sit with her. Nina would sit there giddy & trying to focus but at the same time thinking how cute he was and anxiously waiting for the sign of peace (because they might hug!).

  The first couple of Masses like this Charlie would sit down after Mass and, it seemed like he was back in deep prayer, so Nina would nervously say goodbye and leave. It took her awhile of kicking herself before, at last, she went back into the Cathedral to where he was sitting and asked if he’d like to grab dinner. He eagerly said yes and they had our first night to really get to know each other in new ways.

  What Nina and Charlie realized at that dinner, was that they had known each other for most of their lives! As it turned out, they were in plays together at Chaminade, Charlie’s high school, including “Jesus Christ Superstar” where Nina was one of the apostles and he, well, was Leper #5. Also, they figured out that the parish Nina worked at as DRE was Charlie’s home parish where his family grew up. It only then dawned on them that they had helped lead a Confirmation retreat together! Eventually they realized just how many mutual friends we had through St. Louis’ tightly ­knit Catholic community.
