  The solitaire diamond was given to Charlie to use from his mother, Libby, which was also the center diamond in her engagement ring.
  
  Charlie designed the engagement ring based off of a ring Nina received from her parents when she was 16, which had a center blue stone, with 2 smaller diamonds on the side.
