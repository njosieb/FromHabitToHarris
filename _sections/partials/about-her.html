   Nina has lived in St. Louis for most of her life and has  had many opprtunities to travel and see the world, which she loves to do.  She enjoys singing & playing guitar, although she wishes she had more time to devote to it.  When Nina was growing up, she dreamed of being a famous singer/superstar like Celine Dion!  When she realized that wasn't in the cards & that God had other plans for her, she entered a convent in Miami, Fl. She came home almost 3 years later and became the Director of Religious Education at St. Clare of Assisi Parish, where she was baptized as a baby and coincidentally Charlie's family parish. Nina always hoped to find someone like Charlie, so when he asked her out date, she was very excited at what that could bring to her future. Nina is very much looking forward to married life with Charlie!
