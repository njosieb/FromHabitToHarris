  Nina was the youngest child, then the middle child, and for one short summer considered oldest child, in her family. She has one older brother, Andy, from their mom Vicki (nee. Signorino) and their father John Blaida. John remarried to Linda (nee. Mette), and Nina gained two step-siblings: Jen and Ryan. A few years later, John and Linda had a boy named JP, making Nina a middle child. However, while Nina was studying in Chicago she lived with John, Linda, and JP, and therefore reigned unofficially as the oldest sibling. She loves to sing and was in the Young Catholic Musicians choir growing up, and she loves to cook Italian in her mom's family's grand traditions.

  Nina entered a convent after gradutating from Loyola University of Chicago. She had considered the possibility of being a nun ever since high school, and after spending two semesters abroad in Rome in college she knew the convent was just right for her. After all, her childhood dream of being a famous singer/superstar like Celine Dion wasn't going anywhere fast so becoming a nun seemed more realistic to her at that point in her life.

   She spent 3 years at a convent in Miami, Fl., joining a religous community called the Servants of the Pierced Hearts of Jesus and Mary. There she was formed in the daily life of the sisters: praying, working, sharing meals, and serving the mostly Hispanic community in that part of Miami. Only on one occasion did Nina think she saw Pitbull in the communion line, but it turned out to be someone else.

   Life in the convent had its ups and downs, and for Nina she came to discern that this convent wasn't where God was calling her. She left and flew home to her mom and step-dad in St. Louis, who immediately brought her on a shopping spree through the mall because they had sold all her clothes, thinking she was going to stay a nun in Miami. Nina worked hard to find a job and soon became the Director of Religious Education at St. Clare of Assisi Parish, the same parish she was baptized as a baby and, coincidentally, Charlie's own home parish which he grew up in...(this is where our story continues!)
