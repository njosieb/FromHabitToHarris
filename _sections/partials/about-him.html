  Charlie has lived in St. Louis for most of his life and is the oldest of 5 siblings. He takes very much pride in the fact that he attended Chaminade, where he met many friends that he is still very close to. Charlie spent 6 1/2 years seriously discerning the Priesthood at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. Since discerning out of the seminary, he has begun working at World Wide Technology, where he is a Web Developer. He enjoys swimming, developing websites, making people laugh, and building bonfires in the back yard.  Although Charlie claims to not like to run, he has completed 2 marathons in 2 years one in St. Louis in April 2014 and one in Chicago in October 2015.
